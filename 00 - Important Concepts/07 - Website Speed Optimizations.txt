Website Speed Optimizations

1) Compress images (Refer - https://github.com/akshaychauhan-ac/front-end/blob/master/00%20-%20Important%20Concepts/03%20-%20Optimize%20Images.txt)
2) Don't host your videos locally -
    a) Enable lazy loading
    b) Make bitrate adaptive
    c) Use preloading
    d) Compress your videos
3) Avoid too many animations
4) Optimize your code
    a) Minimize code size
    b) Remove unused code
    c) Reduce server requests
5) Utilize server-side caching
6) Minimize external resources
7) Use lazy loading
8) Minimize HTTP requests
9) Use CDN
10) Leverage browser caching
11) Reduce number of redirects
12) Enable Keep-Alive (timeout)

Time to first byte - HTML document
	Reduce time to first byte - deliver the initial page as quickly as possible
		Use a CDN to reduce network distance
		Upgrade server hardware for faster processing
		Ensure response bodies can be streamed
Resource load delay
	Eliminate unnecessary resource load delay - ensure the LCP resource starts loading as soon as possible
		Add priority hints or preload
		Minimize network contention
		Use same origin resources(if possible)
Resource load time - Image resource (Optimize images)
	Reduce resource load time - reduce LCP resource load time without compromising quality
		Compress images
		Use modern image formats (avif/webp)
		Properly size images (intrinsic size should be same as rendered size)
		Set far-future cache expiry headers (both browser and CDN)
		Use a CDN to reduce network distance
Element render delay
	Eliminate unnecessary element render delay - ensure the LCP element can render immediately after its resource has finished loading
		Remove or minimize render blocking stylesheets
		Defer render blocking JS
		Use font-display optional
