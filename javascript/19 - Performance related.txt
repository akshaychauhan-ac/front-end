prefetching/preloading
    Preloaded chunks will be loaded with higher priority in parallel to its parent chunk. Mark chunks to be preloaded only if you are confident that the user will interact with them immediately. This can be a dropdown or the contents of a tab.
    Prefetched chunks have lower priority and will be loaded in the browser’s idle time. In other words, mark chunks to be prefetched if the user may need them at some point. This can be the next page he is most likely to visit. He won’t request it immediately but you want it to be there when he does.
